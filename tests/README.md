## Running the tests

```bash
pytest                        # everything
pytest tests/unit/            # unit tests only (fast, ~1 s)
pytest tests/integration/     # integration tests only (slow, ~2 min)
pytest tests/unit/test_genBitstream.py::ClassName::test_name -v
```

## How the integration tests work

`TestFullBitstreamIntegration` and `TestFullBitstreamIntegrationEdgeCases`
are parametrized over all three designs via the session-scoped `design`
fixture in `conftest.py`.  Each test is therefore executed three times —
once per design — and its name will include the design name in brackets,
e.g. `test_bitstream_output_matches_expected[sequential_16bit_en]`.

For each run the test:
1. Writes the shared `bitStreamSpec.bin` spec into a temporary directory.
2. Calls `gen_bitstream(design.fasm_path, spec_file, output_base)`.
3. Compares the generated files against the corresponding files in
   `tests/test_data/<design>/reference/`.

`TestFullBitstreamIntegrationFaultCases` is not parametrized — it only
needs the shared spec to probe error paths (missing files, bad tile names,
etc.) and does not depend on design-specific inputs.

## Reference outputs

The files in `reference/` were produced by `bit_gen` before any refactoring
and must not be modified unless you intentionally change the output format.
They serve as the ground truth for regression detection.

The `.hex` files (present for the bouncy designs only) are byte-per-line hex
dumps of the bitstream, produced by a separate tool.  `bit_gen` does not
generate `.hex` output; these files are kept for context and future use.

## Fixtures (`conftest.py`)

| Fixture | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `minimal_spec_dict` | function | tiny synthetic spec for unit tests |
| `temp_output_dir` | function | `tmp_path` wrapper, auto-cleaned |
| `test_data_dir` | session | `Path` to `tests/test_data/` |
| `real_spec_dict` | session | deserialized `bitStreamSpec.bin` |
| `design` | session ×3 | paths for one design (fasm + reference outputs) |
| `synthetic_fasm_lines` | function | hand-crafted `FasmLine` list |
| `synthetic_fasm_lines_with_clk` | function | includes a CLK line (filtered) |
| `synthetic_fasm_lines_invalid_tile` | function | tile absent from spec |

To add a new design, drop its files under `tests/test_data/<name>/` and
add the directory name to the `_DESIGNS` list in `conftest.py`.
